## Project Description

### Objective 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a methodological set of steps in the design of a software architecture for a set of requirements provided by your instructor. The expected design approach to take is the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) presented in the course.

### ADD Process
Requirements (Functional, Quality, Constraints) --> ADD PROCESS --> Containers (Responsibilities, Interactions, Information Flow)

The ADD is a 7 step process with the expectation of 2-3 iterations steps of the process. 
  
1. INTO System
  - Design objectives 
  - Primary functional requirements
  - Quality attribute scenarios 
  - Constraints 
  - Concerns
2. STEPS
  - Step 1: Review Inputs
  - Step 2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
  - Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the system to decompose
  - Step 4: Choose one or more design conceptsthatsatisfy the selected drivers
  - Step 5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities and define interfaces
  - Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions
  - Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and design objectives
  - Step 8: Refine as necessary
3. OUT of System
 - Software architecture design

One of the most common types of software systems is the greenfield systems in mature domains type of system that is a new system but based on existing architecture patterns and styles. In this type of sys them the norm is to perform 3 iterations of the ADD method with the respective goals of i) defining the structure of the system, ii) defining the components of the architecture to achieve the functional requirements of the systems, and iii) refactoring the architecture to achieve the quality requirements of the system. 

### Deliverables
The expectation is to submit a document that demonstrates the ADD steps as applied to the design of
an architecture for a Course Management System (CMS). The deliverables are divided into 2
submissions. The first submission is part of a question in assignment 2 which includes capturing the
use cases, quality attributes and constraint requirements of the CMS and is submitted prior to the
CMS design stage that is part of the deliverables of the project.
The project deliverable should follow the format presented in the FCAPS case example in the book
“Designing Software Architectures: A Practical Approach” by Humberto Cervantes and Rick
Kazman. What is very important is to include the Design Decisions and rationale for the steps as is
done in the FCAPS example.
All deliverables should be uploaded to a GitHub repository that will automatically be created for the
project as an assignment and you will receive an invitation to join as a group. Your progress in the
project will be graded the based on GitHub commitments of the deliverables and use of the KanBan
project board available in GitHub. A good way to manage your project is by leveraging the Issues
tagging available through GitHub and the automated KanBan project board.

#### Team Assessment Feedback
As a requirement of the project there is a team assessment evaluation that should be completed. The
purpose of this team evaluation is for the team to demonstrate success in a team based project. This
will be assessed by assessing the individual members’ contribution to GitHub. 

## Grading Scheme

1. Report appearance and readability [10 marks]
2. ADD Iteration 1 [15 marks]
3. ADD Iteration 2 [15 marks]
4. ADD Iteration 3 [15 marks]
5. Team and Individual contribution [5 marks]
