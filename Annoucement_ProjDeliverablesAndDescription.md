I have updated the project deliverables and description file since it contained a couple of pages in the end that were part of the previous course and so they were not relevant. 

Also the drop box was deleted as the submission is to be done via GitHub. Please go to the following web site:

https://classroom.github.com/g/-OhiE9ow

and create or join a group based on your student ID. You can use your existing GitHub accounts but you need to associate this account with a student ID from the drop down list. 

Note this is a group project so the first person to sign in needs to create the group name. For simplicity please use your group ID from banner. Once the group is created the other person can join that group.

Put your deliverables in separate folders (i.e. Iteration 1, Iteration 2, Iteration 3) and use the KanBan project template to manage your project.
